- Report available at: https://github.com/mtwang0912/Signal-Analysis-Higgs-Boson/blob/main/02020640_Project2_Report.pdf

# Project Overview
This project, titled "Optimization of Signal Analysis in Discovering the Higgs Boson," aims to enhance the sensitivity of signal analysis in Higgs boson detection. It focuses on numerical integration methods to maximize average significance and establish optimal selection cuts for analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

# Main Features
## Objectives
- Maximize detection sensitivity for Higgs boson decay.
- Determine the optimal selection cuts for invariant mass analysis, thereby enhancing detection probability.

## Numerical Methods and Analysis
### Integration Methods Evaluated:
- Monte Carlo Integration Method (MCIM)
- Extended Trapezoidal Method (ETM)
- Midpoint Riemann Method (MRM)
- Extended Simpson‚Äôs Method (ESM)
- Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method (RK4M)
- Error Scaling: Methods were analyzed based on their error scaling properties, from ùëÇ(‚Ñé) for MCIM to ùëÇ(‚Ñé^4) for ESM and RK4M.
